## When to use

Use this skill whenever you are:

- Creating E2E, UI, or integration tests
- Testing login, registration, or navigation flows
- Handling permission dialogs (camera, location, notifications)
- Debugging test failures or exploring UI hierarchy
- Working with Maestro test files (.yaml)

## Captions

When dealing with native permission dialogs, load the [./rules/permissions.md](./rules/permissions.md) file for platform-specific information.

When working with Flutter apps, load the [./rules/platforms/flutter.md](./rules/platforms/flutter.md) file for Semantics patterns.

When testing `packages/react-native-payments-example` in this repo, load the [./rules/rnw-community.md](./rules/rnw-community.md) file first for the package's app targets, appIds, flow layout, local run scripts, fleet labels, and artifact locations.

## How to use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:
